        <h1>Niccolò Ridi</h1>
        <p class="welcome-text">You've reached Niccolò Ridi’s landing page. Welcome.</p>
        
        <p class="main-text">A man of law, letters, and a hint of dry wit, Niccolò Ridi serves as an Associate Director at the Centre for International Governance and Dispute Resolution (CIGAD) and Lecturer in Public International Law at The Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College London.</p>

        <p class="main-text">Niccolò's academic wanderlust has taken him from the verdant quads of Cambridge to the Florentine vistas of his alma mater. With degrees from the University of Florence, University of Cambridge, and King's College London under his belt, his intellectual pedigree is as diverse as it is impressive.</p>

        <p class="main-text">In the calm before the storm that is academia, Niccolò is crafting two books: one on the use of precedent in international adjudication, the other on the principle of comity in international law. Yes, that's right, two books. Because why stop at one when you can do twice the work?</p>

        <p class="main-text">In summary, Niccolò Ridi is a curious blend of academia, wit, and a dash of British humour. A seasoned navigator in the world of international law, he is both a dedicated scholar and an engaging, occasionally humorous, guide. Don't expect any wigs or robes, though. He saves those for special occasions.</p>
